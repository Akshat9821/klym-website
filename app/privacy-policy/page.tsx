              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">4.1 Third-party Providers and Why We Share Face Data</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Face data collected from you is shared only with Orbo, our trusted third-party provider specializing in skin imaging and analysis. Orbo uses your selfie image to generate a detailed visual skin analysis report through advanced computer vision algorithms.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We do not share face data with AWS, GCP, OpenAI, or any other third parties. These services are used strictly for encrypted data storage (AWS/GCP) or metadata processing (OpenAI), not for receiving or analyzing raw face images.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">4.2 Third-party Storage Practices</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4 mb-4">
                <li><strong>AWS and GCP:</strong> Used solely for secure cloud storage of encrypted facial images and metadata. They do not access, process, or analyze this data.</li>
                <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Does not store or process facial images. It may process non-image metadata (e.g., skin concern tags) to generate skincare advice but has no access to selfie images.</li>
                <li><strong>Orbo:</strong> Does not store facial photos or feature vectors. According to Orbo's official privacy policy, all facial image processing is done entirely on-device using their SDKs, and no facial images or vectors are uploaded to or stored on their servers. Orbo does not retain, reuse, resell, or transmit face data beyond the local session on the user's device.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">4.3 Data Storage Locations</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                All collected data, including facial images and related metadata, is securely stored in cloud infrastructure provided by AWS and GCP. These cloud providers operate in data centers compliant with rigorous global data protection standards and best security practices.

                <li><strong>Original face images:</strong> Retained for up to 30 days from the date of your last activity to enable consistent follow-ups and repeat consultations.</li>
                <li><strong>Facial metadata:</strong> Retained only as long as needed to provide personalized services or until the user requests deletion.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

                Your explicit consent for facial data collection is obtained clearly by your act of granting camera access permission to capture selfies. Consent may be withdrawn and full data deletion executed anytime by requesting account deletion directly through the app's account settings.
