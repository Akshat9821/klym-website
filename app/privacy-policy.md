Welcome to KLYM ("App," "Platform," or "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains in detail how Gram AI Technologies Private Limited ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, stores, protects, and manages your personal data, including highly sensitive facial information.

## 2. Data Collection
### 2.1 Face Data
KLYM collects your selfie image via the app's camera module. This data specifically includes high-resolution photographic images capturing your facial features, contours, and identifiable characteristics for skin analysis.
### 2.2 Other Personal Information
We also collect the following personal information:
- Name
- Gender
- Age
- Phone number
- Email address
- Residential and delivery address
- Payment information (credit/debit card details, UPI IDs, or other payment methods)

## 3. Usage of Face Data
The collected facial data is exclusively and explicitly used for the following purposes:
- Generating detailed, personalized skin analysis reports based on specific skin parameters
- Creating and delivering tailored skincare routines personalized to your unique skin profile
- Training and refining our proprietary AI and machine learning models for continuously enhanced skincare recommendations
- Quality assurance and accuracy verification through manual review by authorized and trained professionals within our organization

## 4. Third-party Sharing & Storage
### 4.1 Third-party Providers and Why We Share Face Data
Face data collected from you is shared only with Orbo, our trusted third-party provider specializing in skin imaging and analysis. Orbo uses your selfie image to generate a detailed visual skin analysis report through advanced computer vision algorithms.
We do not share face data with AWS, GCP, OpenAI, or any other third parties. These services are used strictly for encrypted data storage (AWS/GCP) or metadata processing (OpenAI), not for receiving or analyzing raw face images.
### 4.2 Third-party Storage Practices
- **AWS and GCP:** Used solely for secure cloud storage of encrypted facial images and metadata. They do not access, process, or analyze this data.
- **OpenAI:** Does not store or process facial images. It may process non-image metadata (e.g., skin concern tags) to generate skincare advice but has no access to selfie images.
- **Orbo:** Does not store facial photos or feature vectors. According to Orbo’s official privacy policy, all facial image processing is done entirely on-device using their SDKs, and no facial images or vectors are uploaded to or stored on their servers. Orbo does not retain, reuse, resell, or transmit face data beyond the local session on the user’s device.
### 4.3 Data Storage Locations
All collected data, including facial images and related metadata, is securely stored in cloud infrastructure provided by AWS and GCP. These cloud providers operate in data centers compliant with rigorous global data protection standards and best security practices.

## 5. Data Retention
- **Original face images:** Retained for up to 30 days from the date of your last activity to enable consistent follow-ups and repeat consultations.
- **Facial metadata:** Retained only as long as needed to provide personalized services or until the user requests deletion.
We do not retain face data indefinitely without purpose. Our retention timelines are driven by transparency, necessity, and compliance with privacy principles.

## 6. User Consent & Transparency
Your explicit consent for facial data collection is obtained clearly by your act of granting camera access permission to capture selfies. Consent may be withdrawn and full data deletion executed anytime by requesting account deletion directly through the app’s account settings.

## 7. User Rights (DPDP/GDPR Compliance)
Under applicable laws and standards (DPDP Act, GDPR, and global privacy regulations), you hold the following rights regarding your data:
- Right to Access
- Right to Correction
- Right to Data Portability
- Right to Erasure
Exercise these rights by contacting support@klym.life.

## 8. Data Security
We maintain stringent security protocols to protect your data:
- Advanced encryption methods protect your data in transit and when stored
- Regular, independent third-party security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Robust and secure cloud infrastructure is maintained via reputable providers (AWS and GCP)
- Strict internal access control, multi-factor authentication, and security monitoring protocols are continuously enforced

## 9. Children’s Privacy
KLYM is strictly designed for users aged 16 and above. If we become aware that a user younger than 16 years has provided us with personal information, including facial data, we take immediate steps to permanently delete such information from our records.
